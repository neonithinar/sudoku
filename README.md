Sudoku puzzle solver
I am working on a project to create a sudoku game for android / PC or any based on python codes in this repo
My objective is to be able to pass any sudoku puzzle image and extract sudoku puzzle from that image (that is tolerant to slight rotation, 
skewing or else as a result of improper camera angle from  an edge device) by identifying the digits using CNN (that way hopefully works
for handwritten puzzles as well), then solves the puzzle using a standard solver algorithm
